# ABSTRACT
Twitter is a global micro-blogging internet service on which users post and interact with messages known as “tweets”. 
A key characteristic of Twitter is its efficiency of information dissemination to a broad audience in a short matter 
of time. The purpose of this project is to analyze tweets to determine whether the sentiment of the language contains
hate speech or not. This project will employ natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistic 
methods as the means of classification. Future applications of such analysis may allow users to monitor large customer
markets with an active online user base to determine customer satisfaction, consumer trends and underlying social models.

## CONTENTS
1. Final Paper: Final write up of project.
2. Project.pdf: Guidelines for project.
3. train.csv: csv file consisting of labeled tweets for training the algorithm
4. test_tweets.csv: csv file containing unlabeled tweets used for testing algorithm
5. test_predictions.csv: csv file of labeled test data after using logistic regression
6. twitter_Analysis.ipynb: python code I used, ran in jupyter notebook.

This project was built using python 3 using jupyter notebook on my MacBook. Must specify the location of the test
and training files within code before running!

### Tutorial
This project was inspired by Analytic [Vidhya's practice problem](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/). Project follows this [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/hands-on-sentiment-analysis-dataset-python/) as a guide to learning the basics of Twitter Analysis.
