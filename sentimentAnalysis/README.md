# ABSTRACT
Twitter is a global micro-blogging internet service on which users post and interact with messages known as “tweets”. 
A key characteristic of Twitter is its efficiency of information dissemination to a broad audience in a short matter 
of time. The purpose of this project is to analyze tweets to determine whether the sentiment of the language contains
hate speech or not. This project will employ natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistic 
methods as the means of classification. Future applications of such analysis may allow users to monitor large customer
markets with an active online user base to determine customer satisfaction, consumer trends and underlying social models.
